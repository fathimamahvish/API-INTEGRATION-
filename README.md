🚀 React API Integration Projects – Axios | GET & POST Requests
Over the past few days, I've been working on learning and implementing API handling in React using Axios. I'm excited to share two small but powerful components I've built:
✅ GetApi Component – Fetches and displays data from a REST API (with error handling and elegant 3D-style UI cards).
✅ PostForm Component – Submits user data via POST requests to an API, complete with form state management and 3D-styled inputs.
🛠️ Tech Stack:
React.js (Class Components)
Axios for API calls
JSONPlaceholder API
Inbuilt CSS for 3D visual effects
These exercises helped me strengthen my understanding of:
Lifecycle methods (componentDidMount)
Controlled components in React
API response handling & error feedback
Creating polished UI/UX without external CSS libraries
